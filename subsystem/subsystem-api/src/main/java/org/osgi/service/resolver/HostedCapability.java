/**
 * A HostedCapability is a Capability where the {@link #getResource()} method

 * is necessary for cases where the declared Resource of a Capability does not
 * match the runtime state. This is for example the case for fragments, when a fragment
 * attaches a host, most of its Capabilities and Requirements become hosted by
 * the attached host. Since a fragment can attach multiple hosts, a single
 * Capability can actually be hosted multiple times.
