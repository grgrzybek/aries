   * 
   * <p>
   * The resolve method returns the delta between the start state defined by
   * {@link Environment#getWiring()} and the end resolved state, i.e. only new
   * resources and wires are included. To get the complete resolution the caller
   * can merge the start state and the delta using something like the following:
   * 
   * <pre>Map&lt;Resource, List&lt;Wire&gt;&gt; delta = resolver.resolve(env, requirement);
Map&lt;Resource, List&lt;Wire&gt;&gt; wiring = env.getWiring();

  Resource res = e.getKey();
  List&lt;Wire&gt; newWires = e.getValue();
  
  List&lt;Wire&gt; currentWires = wiring.get(res);
  if (currentWires != null) {
    newWires.addAll(currentWires);
  }
  
  wiring.put(res, newWires);
}</pre>
   * 
   * <h3>Consistency</h3>
   * <p>
   * For a given resolve call an environment should return a consistent set of
   * capabilities and wires. The simplest mechanism of achieving this is by
   * creating an immutable snapshot of the environment state and passing this to
   * the resolve method.
   * 
   * <p>
   * If {@link Requirement#getResource} returns null then the
   * requirement can be wired to any matching capability regardless of the
   * "uses" constraint directive from the capability. This is because there is
   * no Resource available to do a class space consistency check against.
   * 
   * @param environment
   *          the environment into which to resolve the requirements
   * 
   * @param requirements The requirements that the resolver must satisfy
   * @return the new resources and wires required to satisfy the requirements
   * 
   * @throws ResolutionException if the resolution cannot be satisified for any reason
   * @throws NullPointerException if environment or any of the requirements are null
