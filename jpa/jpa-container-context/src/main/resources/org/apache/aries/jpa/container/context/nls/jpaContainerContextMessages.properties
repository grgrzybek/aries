close.called.on.container.manged.em=It is forbidden to call close on a container managed EntityManager.
getTransaction.called.on.container.managed.em=Transaction management is not available for container managed EntityManagers.
no.active.transaction=There is no currently active transaction.
no.transaction.manager=No JTA transaction services implementation is currently available. As a result the JPA container \
 cannot integrate with JTA transactions.
# {0} The transaction on the thread.
tran.not.active=Unable to create a persistence context for the transaction {0} because the is not active.
# {0} The transaction on the thread.
unable.to.register.synchronization=No persistence context could be created as the JPA container could not register a \
 synchronization with the transaction {0}.
# {0} The service reference of the tran sync registry.
tran.sync.registry.arrived=A TransactionSynchronizationRegistry service is now available in the runtime. Managed \
 persistence contexts will now integrate with JTA transactions using {0}.
# {0} The service reference of the tran sync registry.
tran.sync.registry.replace=The TransactionSynchronizationRegistry used to manage persistence contexts has been replaced. \
 The new TransactionSynchronizationRegistry, {0}, will now be used to manage persistence contexts. Managed persistence \
 contexts may not work correctly unless the runtime uses the new JTA Transaction services implementation to manage transactions.
tran.sync.registry.gone=The TransactionSynchronizationRegistry used to manage persistence contexts is no longer available. \
  Managed persistence contexts will no longer be able to integrate with JTA transactions, and will behave as if  no there \
  is no transaction context at all times until a new TransactionSynchronizationRegistry is available. Applications using \
  managed persistence contexts may not work correctly until a new JTA Transaction services implementation is available.
# {0} The entity manager properties.
error.closing.entity.manager=There was an error when the container closed an EntityManager with the properties {0}.
# {0} The persistence context
# {1} The bundle symbolic name
# {2} the bundle version
no.tran.manager.for.bundle=No JTA integration is currently available. The managed persistence context {0} used by the \
 bundle {1}/{2} will operate with no transaction context and be read only until a JTA Transaction Services implementation \
 is available in the runtime.
# {0} The bundle symbolic name
# {1} the bundle version
no.context.manager.for.framework=An unexpected condition was hit. There was no context manager for framework {0}/{1}. This \
 should never happen.
quiesce.manager.not.there=No quiesce support is available, so managed persistence units will not participate in quiesce operations.
extended.em.not.supported=Extended scope EntityManagers are not supported.
# {0} The EMF filter
emf.filter.invalid=An unexpected condition was hit. The generated filter for the EntityManagerFactory {0} was invalid. This \
 should never happen.
# {0} The PU service
pu.registered.multiple.times=The persistence unit {0} has been registered again at the same framework scope. The persistence \
 unit {0} will be ignored.
# {0} The bundle symbolic name
# {1} The bundle version
# {2} The persistence context
# {3} The persistence context properties
# {4} The properties of the existing context.
persistence.context.exists.multiple.times=The bundle {0}/{1} depends on a managed persistence context {2} with properties {3}, \
 but the context already exists with properties {4}. The existing properties will be used.
# {0} The persistence unit name
# {1} The persistence context
# {2} The properties
null.pu.or.props=The managed persistence context {0} cannot be registered for persistence unit {1} and properties {2}
# {0} The persistence unit name
possible.livelock.recovery=Recovering from a potential live-lock registering a container managed peristence context for persistence \
 unit {0}.
# {0} The persistence unit name
interruption.waiting.for.pu.unregister=The Aries JPA container was interrupted when waiting for managed persistence context {0} to \
 be unregistered.
# {0} The persistence unit name
possible.livelock.detected=The JPA container detected a possible live lock whilst unregistering the managed persistence context {0}. \
 The service cannot be unregistered immediately so the context may become unusable before being unregistered.
# {0} Method name not found
# {1} The persistence unit name
wrong.JPA.version="Method {0} is not implemented by delegate {1}. Probably you want use JPA 2.1 but you are installed JPA 2.0."
